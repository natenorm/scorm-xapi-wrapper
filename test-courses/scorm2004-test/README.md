# SCORM 2004 Comprehensive Test Course

This is a complete test course designed to thoroughly test all SCORM 2004 functionality with SCORM Cloud.

## Features Tested

✅ **Multi-page Navigation** - 5 pages with Previous/Next buttons
✅ **Progress Tracking** - Tracks current page and visited pages  
✅ **Resume Functionality** - Close and reopen to test suspend/resume
✅ **Quiz with Scoring** - 5 questions with automatic grading
✅ **Data Storage** - All state stored in `cmi.suspend_data`
✅ **Completion Logic** - Marks complete based on quiz results
✅ **Pass/Fail Status** - Sets `cmi.success_status` correctly
✅ **Debug Panel** - Real-time view of all SCORM data

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Course

```bash
cd "/Users/nathan/projects/SCORM Wrapper/test-courses/scorm2004-test"
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8080`

**Local Testing Notes:**
- Environment shows as "local" (uses localStorage)
- All features work the same
- Debug panel shows all data
- Test navigation, quiz, and completion

### 3. Create SCORM Package

```bash
npm run package
```

Creates `scorm2004-test.zip` ready for upload to SCORM Cloud.

## Testing in SCORM Cloud

### Upload to SCORM Cloud

1. Go to [SCORM Cloud](https://cloud.scorm.com/)
2. Create account (free)
3. Click "Upload Content"

- [ ] Suspend data contains JSON with course state

### Quiz Answer Key

For testing, here are the correct answers:

1. **What does SCORM stand for?** → **A** (Sharable Content Object Reference Model)
2. **Which element stores custom course data?** → **B** (cmi.suspend_data)
3. **What is the SCORM 2004 API object name?** → **A_1484_11**
4. **What format is used for SCORM packages?** → **B** (ZIP file with imsmanifest.xml)
5. **What does cmi.success_status indicate?** → **B** (Whether the learner passed or failed)

**Pass score: 70% (4 or 5 correct)**

## Expected SCORM Data

When testing in SCORM Cloud, you should see:

### CMI Elements Set

```
cmi.location = "5" (last page visited)
cmi.suspend_data = {"currentPage":5,"totalPages":5,"visitedPages":[1,2,3,4,5],...}
cmi.completion_status = "completed"
cmi.success_status = "passed" (if score ≥ 70%) or "failed" (if < 70%)
cmi.score.scaled = 0.80 (for 80%)
cmi.score.raw = 80
cmi.score.min = 0
cmi.score.max = 100
```

### Suspend Data Structure

```json
{
  "currentPage": 5,
  "totalPages": 5,
  "visitedPages": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "quizAnswers": {
    "q1": "A",
    "q2": "B",
    "q3": "B",
    "q4": "B",
    "q5": "B"
  },
  "quizScore": 100,
  "quizGraded": true,
  "completed": true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Environment shows "local" in SCORM Cloud

**Problem:** API not detected
**Fix:** 
- Check browser console for `[Detector]` logs
- Verify imsmanifest.xml is at root of ZIP
- Try refreshing/relaunching
- Check SCORM Cloud documentation

### Resume not working

**Problem:** Always starts on Page 1
**Solutions:**
- Verify suspend_data is being saved (check SCORM Cloud debug)
- Check that `cmi.location` is set
- Make sure you're clicking "Continue" not "New Attempt"

### Quiz not saving

**Problem:** Answers lost on navigation
**Fix:**
- Should save automatically when navigating away from Page 4
- Check debug panel to see current answers
- Verify suspend_data in SCORM Cloud

### Completion not registering

**Problem:** LMS shows incomplete
**Solutions:**
- Make sure quiz is completed first
- Verify you clicked "Complete Course" button on Page 5
- Check that `cmi.completion_status` = "completed" in LMS
- Some LMS require explicit "Exit" - check your LMS documentation

## Debug Panel

The debug panel at the bottom shows:

- **Environment:** scorm2004 (in LMS) or local (local dev)
- **Current Page:** Which page you're on
- **Quiz Answers:** Current answers selected
- **Quiz Score:** Score percentage
- **Completion Status:** Whether completed
- **Data Saved:** Confirmation of last save

### Debug Actions

- **🔄 Load Data:** Shows raw saved data in alert
- **🗑️ Clear Data:** Resets everything and reloads (for testing)

## Success Criteria

If this test course works correctly in SCORM Cloud, it proves:

✅ SCORM API detection works (pipwerks-style)
✅ Data persistence works (suspend_data)
✅ Resume functionality works
✅ Scoring works correctly
✅ Completion status works
✅ Pass/fail logic works
✅ The wrapper is production-ready!

## Next Steps After Testing

Once this passes all tests in SCORM Cloud:

1. Create xAPI test course
2. Update main README with success story
3. Publish to npm
4. Share with the world! 🚀
