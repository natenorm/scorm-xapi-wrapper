# Making SCORM Wrapper Available to Others

## ✅ What's Already Done

I've prepared the project so it's **ready to publish to npm**. Here's what's set up:

1. ✅ **Professional CLI** (`cli.js`) - Works cross-platform (Mac, Windows, Linux)
2. ✅ **package.json** - Configured with all the right fields
3. ✅ **`.npmignore`** - Excludes dev files, keeps what users need
4. ✅ **Tested locally** - Already linked and working on your machine

## 🚀 Your Options

### Option 1: Publish to NPM (Recommended ⭐)

**What users will do:**
```bash
npx create-scorm-course my-course
```

**Steps to publish:**

1. **Create npm account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/signup
   - It's free!

2. **Choose a package name**:
   - Check if available: https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-scorm-course
   - Options:
     - `create-scorm-course` (if available)
     - `@yourname/create-scorm-course` (scoped - always available)
     - `scorm-course-creator`

3. **Update package.json**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "create-scorm-course",  // Your chosen name
     "author": "Your Name <your@email.com>",
     "repository": {
       "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/scorm-wrapper.git"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Publish**:
   ```bash
   npm login
   npm publish --access public
   ```

5. **Done!** Now anyone can use:
   ```bash
   npx create-scorm-course@latest my-course
   ```

### Option 2: GitHub Only

**What users will do:**
```bash
# One-time setup:
npm install -g github:yourusername/scorm-wrapper

# Then:
create-scorm-course my-course
```

**Steps:**

1. **Create GitHub repo**
2. **Push your code**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/scorm-wrapper.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Update README** with install instructions

---

### Option 3: GitHub + Manual Clone

**What users will do:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scorm-wrapper.git
cd scorm-wrapper
npm link
create-scorm-course my-course
```

**Steps:**
1. Create GitHub repo
2. Push code
3. Document in README

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Start with GitHub + npm publish:**

1. **Week 1**: Push to GitHub
   - Get feedback
   - Fix any issues
   - Build confidence

2. **Week 2**: Publish to npm
   - Now it's super easy for everyone
   - Professional distribution
   - Discoverable

## 🆘 Questions?

**"What name should I use?"**
→ `create-scorm-course` if available, otherwise `@yourname/create-scorm-course`

**"Do I need GitHub AND npm?"**
→ No, but having both is ideal. GitHub for code, npm for distribution.

**"Can I update it later?"**
→ Yes! Just `npm version patch` and `npm publish` again

**"What if someone finds a bug?"**
→ Fix it, bump version, republish. Users get latest with `@latest`

---

## ✅ Ready to Go!

Everything is prepared. You just need to:

1. Decide on distribution method (I recommend npm!)
2. Update author info in package.json
3. Publish!

**You've built something useful - now share it with the world!** 🚀
