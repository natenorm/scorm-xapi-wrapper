## What I Created

A comprehensive SCORM 2004 test course located at:
```
/Users/nathan/projects/SCORM Wrapper/test-courses/scorm2004-test/
```

## Features

This test course demonstrates **EVERYTHING**:

âœ… **5-Page Multi-Page Course** with navigation
âœ… **Progress Tracking** - saves current page and visited pages
âœ… **Resume Functionality** - close and reopen to test suspend/resume  
âœ… **Interactive Quiz** - 5 multiple choice questions
âœ… **Automatic Scoring** - calculates score and pass/fail
âœ… **Data Storage** - all state in `cmi.suspend_data`
âœ… **Completion Logic** - marks complete based on quiz score
âœ… **Pass/Fail Status** - sets `cmi.success_status` correctly
âœ… **Beautiful UI** - professional gradient design
âœ… **Live Debug Panel** - shows all SCORM data in real-time

## How to Build & Test

### Step 1: Build the Test Course

```bash
cd "/Users/nathan/projects/SCORM Wrapper/test-courses/scorm2004-test"
npm install
npm run build
npm run package
```

This creates `scorm2004-test.zip` ready for SCORM Cloud!

### Step 2: Upload to SCORM Cloud

1. Go to https://cloud.scorm.com/
2. Create free account (if needed)
3. Click "Upload Content"
4. Upload `scorm2004-test.zip`
5. Click "Launch" to test

### Step 3: Test Everything

Follow the checklist in the README to test:
- API detection (should show "scorm2004" not "local")
- Navigation and progress tracking
- Quiz functionality
- **RESUME** (close window, relaunch - should resume where you left off!)
- Completion and scoring
- Pass/fail status

## Expected Results in SCORM Cloud

### Environment Detection
- Debug panel should show **"scorm2004"** (green)
- NOT "local" (yellow)
- Console logs should show: `[Detector] Found SCORM 2004 API after X attempts`

### Navigation
- Pages 1-5 work smoothly
- Progress bar updates
- Previous/Next buttons work
- Current page tracked

### Quiz (Page 4)
- Answer all 5 questions
- Click "Submit Quiz"
- Score calculated immediately
- Pass requires 70% (4 or 5 correct)

### Resume (THE BIG TEST!)
1. Navigate to Page 3
2. **Close the course window**
3. Go back to SCORM Cloud
4. Click "Continue" or "Launch"
5. **Should open on Page 3!** (not Page 1)
6. All progress preserved
7. Quiz answers preserved if taken

### Completion
- Take quiz on Page 4
- Go to Page 5
- Click "Complete Course"
- Alert confirms completion
- LMS should show:
  - Completion: "Completed" âœ…
  - Success: "Passed" or "Failed" (based on score)
  - Score: Your percentage

## Quiz Answer Key

For easy testing:
1. A (Sharable Content Object Reference Model)
2. B (cmi.suspend_data)
3. B (API_1484_11)
4. B (ZIP file with imsmanifest.xml)  
5. B (Whether the learner passed or failed)

**All B's except first = 80% = PASS! âœ…**

## What This Proves

If this works in SCORM Cloud, it proves:

âœ… **pipwerks-style API detection works** - no more "local" fallback!
âœ… **Synchronous detection** - no unnecessary 5s wait
âœ… **Frame traversal works** - finds API in parent windows
âœ… **Plateau LMS support** - handles edge cases
âœ… **Data persistence works** - suspend_data saves/loads
âœ… **Resume works** - proper location tracking
âœ… **Scoring works** - correct CMI elements
âœ… **Completion works** - proper status management
âœ… **The wrapper is PRODUCTION READY!** ðŸš€
